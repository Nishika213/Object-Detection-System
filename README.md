# Object-Detection-System
A CPU-efficient computer vision system for real-time video processing that detects objects and hierarchical sub-objects. Users can retrieve sub-object images for a given object, and the results are output in a specified JSON format. I ensured that the system met real-time performance benchmarks while optimizing for efficiency.
